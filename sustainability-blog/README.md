Not registered users can access the home, where the last 3 added products are shown, and  products menu, where all products are listed with their details. Also have access to register or log directly in their accounts.

Only registered users can create new posts and add, edit or remove their own products. Within this community the registered users can interact via likes/comments with all other posts.
